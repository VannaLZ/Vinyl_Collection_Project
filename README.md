# Vynil_Collection_Project 

<p align='justify'>
:wave: Hi there! I recently completed a Data Analytics bootcamp where I gained a strong foundation in <i>Data Analysis</i> and related skills. During the course, we had the opportunity to discuss potential projects with a professor. Initially, I had a different idea in mind, but as I progressed, my interests evolved, and I decided to pursue something I am truly passionate about - <b>music</b> :musical_score: and <b>vinyl</b> ðŸŸ£ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µðŸŸ¡ðŸŽµ.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
Therefore, I started a project on GitHub :octocat: to keep track of my progress and to continue learning and exercising my skills in this field. While the project may not be what I had initially envisioned, the main objective is to use the knowledge I gained from the bootcamp and to dedicate my time to something I am truly interested in. By doing so, I hope to learn new things, refine my skills, and ultimately achieve personal growth. :muscle:.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
This project will focus on creating a catalog of my vinyl collection ðŸŽ¶, which will include various attributes such as artist, album title, release year, and condition. 
</p>
<p align='justify'>
Additionally, I plan to explore different analytical techniques to gain insights into my collection, such as identifying the most popular artists or tracking the value of certain albums :moneybag:.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
I am excited to embark on this project and share my progress with the GitHub community. Stay tuned for updates! :rocket::notes:.
