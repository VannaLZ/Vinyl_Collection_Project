In February 2023, I completed a Data bootcamp, which provided me with a strong foundation in data analysis and related skills. Towards the end of the program, we had the opportunity to speak with one of the professors about a project we would like to work on after finishing the course.

Initially, I had a different idea in mind, but as I progressed, my interests evolved, and I decided to pursue something I am truly passionate about - music and vinyl ðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ§.

Therefore, I started a project on GitHub to keep track of my progress and to continue learning and exercising my skills in this field. While the project may not be what I had initially envisioned, the main objective is to use the knowledge I gained from the bootcamp and to dedicate my time to something I am truly interested in. By doing so, I hope to learn new things, refine my skills, and ultimately achieve personal growth. ðŸ’ª

This project will focus on creating a catalog of my vinyl collection ðŸŽ¶, which will include various attributes such as artist, album title, release year, and condition. 

Additionally, I plan to explore different analytical techniques to gain insights into my collection, such as identifying the most popular artists or tracking the value of certain albums ðŸ’°.

I am excited to embark on this project and share my progress with the GitHub community. Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€ðŸŽµ
